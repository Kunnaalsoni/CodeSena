ChildChain is the first in class blockchain solution that helps maintaining universal birth records. One decentralized server can be
established in every country of the world.
The database will be migratable and hence a birth record database can be accessed at every server. This makes the birth record
verification easy.
We also aim at reducing a large number of fake birth records by ensuring that all the records are updated in our decentrailzed database. 
We are taking the UN project "Toward Universal Birth Registration" by contributing our bit with this project. We have populated our database
with some fake entries
